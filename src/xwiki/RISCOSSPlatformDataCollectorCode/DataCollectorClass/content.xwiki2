This xclass represents a Data Collector, a script or application which collects a data-point about an OSS project by making a request over the internet. For example, a data collector might be capable of collecting the number of contributors to a project which is hosted on github by using the github API. This xclass contains meta-information about a data collector such as it's name and the command to execute it. Each Data Collector contains it's own xclass which defined the collector-specific configuration parameters such as a URL to access the API.
